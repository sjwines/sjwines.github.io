## Educators and Parents

The **Drone Command - Operation Uplink** skill map introduces students to Artificial Intelligence–inspired decision-making through a fast, game-based coding experience using **Microsoft MakeCode Arcade**.

Throughout the activity, students will program their own underwater drone to collect data, evade enemy sonar buoys, and safely upload their findings to a Navy ship. They’ll also design a simple **AI Advisor HUD** that utilizes “if/else” logic to make recommendations such as *Collect*, *Upload*, or *Avoid*.*

This skillmap is designed for students between the ages of 11 and 16 and takes approximately 60–75 minutes to complete. No previous coding experience is required, and students will not interact with a chatbot during the activity.

6 guided tutorials progressively introduce programming concepts, followed by an open-ended Challenge Lab where students can personalize their game.

| Tutorial                     | Duration | Description |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| **Prepare Your Drone**        | 10 min   | Learn the MakeCode interface, create and move a drone sprite, and follow it with the camera. |
| **Incoming Ship**             | 12 min   | Create the Navy ship, introduce randomness, and position it safely on screen. |
| **Enemy Waters**              | 15 min   | Add data shards, roaming sonar buoys, and collision rules. Enable a sonar pulse to disable enemies. |
| **Upload Complete**           | 8 min    | Add scoring logic and upload rules when touching the ship. Optional “if/else” speed boost logic. |
| **AI Advisor Online**         | 12 min   | Activate the HUD to display suggestions based on thresholds for *Collect*, *Upload*, and *Avoid.* |
| **Challenge Lab**             | 10+ min  | Tinker and expand the game by adjusting speed, adding timers, or spawning more buoys. |

**Notes**:
- Time estimates are approximate; allow extra time for testing, debugging, and creative extensions.
- Students can remix the final project or continue in the full MakeCode editor for additional challenges.

## Learning Objectives

This activity helps students understand how simple AI-style decision rules can guide autonomous behavior while reinforcing key programming concepts such as:

- Sprites, events, and variables  
- Randomness and conditional logic (`if/else`)  
- Loops, collisions, and scoring systems  
- Abstraction and modular code using custom blocks  

### Standards Alignment

**CSTA Standards (Grades 9–10):**
- **3A-AP-13** – Create prototypes using algorithms to solve problems connected to student interests.  
- **3A-AP-15** – Justify control-structure choices (tradeoffs in readability/performance).  
- **3A-AP-16** – Design artifacts using events to initiate instructions.  
- **3A-AP-17** – Decompose problems into components using procedures/modules.  
- **3A-CS-01** – Explain how abstractions hide implementation details.

**NGSS Connections:**
- **HS-ETS1-2** – Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it into smaller, manageable problems.  
- **HS-ETS1-3** – Evaluate a solution based on trade-offs between criteria and constraints (e.g., payload weight vs. battery range).  
- **HS-PS4-5** – Communicate technical information about wave applications in technologies for information transfer (e.g., sonar).

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this skillmap, students will:

- Connect computer science concepts to real-world naval engineering contexts.  
- Design and test an AI-inspired heuristic system using simple decision rules.  
- Reflect on trade-offs between performance, safety, and data collection in autonomous systems.  
- Gain confidence in coding, debugging, and creative problem-solving.

---

## Implementation Tips

- Works well in a **45–75 minute** class period.  
- Suitable for **individuals, pairs, or small groups**; supports differentiated pacing.  
- Designed for **Chromebooks and laptops**.  
- No student accounts required — code is saved locally or as a shareable URL.

## Accessibility & Safety

All student interactions occur within the MakeCode Arcade editor. No chatbots, external data sharing, or personal accounts are used. The activity adheres to COPPA- and FERPA-compliant guidelines for classroom use.
