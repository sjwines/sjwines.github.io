## Educators and Parents

The **Drone Command - Operation Uplink** skill map introduces students to Artificial Intelligence–inspired decision-making through a fast, game-based coding experience using **Microsoft MakeCode Arcade**.

Throughout the activity, students will program their own underwater drone to collect data, evade enemy sonar buoys, and safely upload their findings to a Navy ship. They’ll also design a simple **AI Advisor HUD** that utilizes “if/else” logic to make recommendations such as *Collect*, *Upload*, or *Avoid*.*

This skillmap is designed for students between the ages of 13 and 18 and takes approximately 45–75 minutes to complete. No previous coding experience is required.

6 guided tutorials progressively introduce programming concepts, followed by an open-ended Challenge Lab where students can personalize their game.

| Tutorial                     | Duration | Description |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| **Prepare Your Drone**        | 8 min   | Learn the MakeCode interface, create and move a drone sprite, and follow it with the camera. |
| **Incoming Ship**             | 8 min   | Create the Navy ship, introduce randomness, and position it safely on screen. |
| **Enemy Waters**              | 8 min   | Add data shards, roaming sonar buoys, and collision rules. Enable a sonar pulse to disable enemies. |
| **Upload Complete**           | 8 min   | Add scoring logic and upload rules when touching the ship. |
| **AI Advisor Online**         | 8 min   | Create “if/else” speed boost logic and activate the HUD to display suggestions based on thresholds for *Collect*, *Upload*, and *Avoid.* |
| **Challenge Lab**             | 10+ min  | Tinker and expand the game by adjusting speed, adding timers, or spawning more buoys. |

**Notes**:
- Time estimates are approximate; allow extra time for testing, debugging, and creative extensions.
- Students can remix the final project or continue in the full MakeCode editor for additional challenges.

## Learning Objectives

This activity helps students understand how simple AI-style decision rules can guide autonomous behavior while reinforcing key programming concepts such as:

- Sprites, events, and variables  
- Randomness and conditional logic (`if/else`)  
- Loops, collisions, and scoring systems  
- Abstraction and modular code using custom blocks  

### Standards Alignment

**CSTA Standards (Grades 9–10):**
- **3A-AP-13** – Create prototypes using algorithms to solve problems connected to student interests.  
- **3A-AP-15** – Justify the selection of specific control structures by identifying trade-offs related to implementation, readability, and program performance, and by identifying situations where certain control structures are more appropriate than others. 
- **3A-AP-16** – Design and implement computational artifacts that use events to initiate instructions.
- **3A-AP-17** – Decompose problems into smaller components through the design and use of functions, classes, or modules. 
- **3A-CS-01** – Explain how abstractions hide the underlying implementation details of computing systems embedded in everyday objects.

**NGSS Connections:**
- **HS-ETS1-1** – Analyze a major global challenge to specify qualitative and quantitative criteria and constraints for solutions that account for societal needs and wants.
- **HS-ETS1-2** – Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering. 
- **HS-ETS1-3** – Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics. 
- **HS-ETS1-4** – Use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem with numerous criteria and constraints on interactions within and between systems relevant to the problem.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this skillmap, students will:

- Connect computer science concepts to real-world naval engineering contexts.  
- Design and test an AI-inspired heuristic system using simple decision rules.  
- Reflect on trade-offs between performance, safety, and data collection in autonomous systems.  
- Gain confidence in coding, debugging, and creative problem-solving.

---

## Implementation Tips

- Works well in a **45–75 minutes** class period. The introduction and warm-up activity may take more time. 
- Suitable for **individuals, pairs, or small groups**; supports differentiated pacing.  
- Designed for **Chromebooks and laptops**.  
- No student accounts required — code is saved locally or as a shareable URL.

## Accessibility & Safety

All student interactions occur within the MakeCode Arcade editor. No chatbots, external data sharing, or personal accounts are used. The activity adheres to COPPA- and FERPA-compliant guidelines for classroom use.
